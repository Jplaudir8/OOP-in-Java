# Some DNA concepts ðŸ§¬
A DNA is represented as a sequence of characters, this is what Genome Scientists call a Genomic String. These characters could be:

* Adenine
* Thymine
* Cytosine
* Guanine

The Human genome contains 3 billion characters.

*"ATCGTATACTGAAAACAGCTTTGAGAATCGTATACTGAAAACAGCTTTGAGAATCGTATACTGAAAACAGCTTTGAGAATCGTATACTGAAAACAGCTTTGAGAATCGTATACTGAAAACAGCTTTGAGAATCGTATACTGAAAACAGCTTTGAGAATCGTATACTGAATCGTATACTGAAAACAGCTTTGAGAATCGTATACTGAAAACAGCTTTGAGAATCGTATACTGAAAACAGCTTTGAGAATGAGAAAAACCGATCGTATACTGAAAACAGCTTTGAGAATCGTATACTGAAAACAGCTTTGAGAATCGTATACTGAAAACAGCTTTGAGAATCGTAA"*

> Each of these characters represent a __Nucleotide__, which is the building block of a DNA. 

> Three __Nucleotides__ make a __Codon__ which each describe one __Aminoacid__.

> The *"ATG"* Codon indicates the start of a gene, which is why it is called the __Start Codon__.

> Conversely, The *"TAA"* Codon indicates the end of a gene, which is why it is called the __Stop Codon__.

> Everything that is enclosed between (and including) the Start and Stop Codon is a gene.

> Finding the start and stop codons is not enough to determine if a strand of characters is a gene, we also need to make sure that the number of nucleotides in this strand is a multiple of 3. Let's remember that a gene is composed of codons (which are each composed of 3 nucleotides).
