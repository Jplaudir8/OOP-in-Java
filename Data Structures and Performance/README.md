# Description of the Project üß∞

The project for this course is to build a smart text editor/processor that incorporates ‚Äúintelligent‚Äù behaviors of modern-day text interfaces including autocomplete, flagging misspelled words and spelling auto-correct.

In order to develop this test editor application, I will focus on some basic fundamental data structures including linked lists and trees, and go on to touch on more advanced structures like hashsets, linked lists and tries. And front and center throughout this project will be the subject of code and algorithm efficiency and correctness.

Being more specific and with help of the images below, I will explain what are the actions that this application can do and the features it has:

**Load Text Button:** allows loading an external .txt file to the text field.

**Flesch Index Button:** will allow the user determine the Flesch readability score of text by displaying a number that is basically a measure that approximates how easy a piece of text is to read based on the number of sentences, words and syllables in that text. I am pretty sure you(reader) must be wondering how exactly this application is quantifying the difference between text that is hard to read and text that is easy to read. What is used under the hood here is a famous formula called the Flesch Reading Ease Formula, this formula is known for its accuracy to measure the readability of texts in english and has been developed by the author and writing consultant Rudolph Flesch. The formula and table to asses the ease of readability of texts are the following:

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=Fleschscore = 206.835 - 1.015(\frac{NumberOfWords}{NumberOfSentences})-84.6(\frac{NumberOfSyllables}{NumberOfWords})" height=40>
</p>

So higher scores indicate text that is simple to read, while lower scores indicate more complex text:

| Score     | School Level                     |
|:---------:|:--------------------------------:|
| 90 to 100 | 5th grade                        | 
| 80 to 90  | 6th grade                        |  
| 70 to 80  | 7th grade                        |
| 60 to 70  | 8th and 9th grade                |
| 50 to 60  | 10th to 12th grade (high school) |
| 30 to 50  | college                          |
| 0 to 30   | college graduate                 |

From the formula given, we can conclude that in order to reach a higher score (easy-to-read text) the text would require to have few words per sentence and few syllables per words. This basically means short sentences and short words, whereas in order to get a lower score, we would just need to have the opposite ratio in our text, many words per sentence and many syllables per word.

Here we have text that has been extracted from an ETS GRE passage(this is a graduate-level reading)

**Edit Distance Button:** this enables to measure the number of steps needed to change or mutate from one word to another, the program will calculate how many modifications are needed (what counts as an operation could be either substituting, removing or inserting a letter in the word given) to reach the desired word.

**Markov Text Generator Button:** this will generate a bunch of sentences based on the data that has been collected from the input. The way it works is that based on the frequencies in which consecutive pairs of words have been found, it will generate a model and from here it will predict random text. In this way, the generated sentences would have less probabilities of not being semantic.

**Spelling Suggestions and Autocomplete Checkboxes:** these simply enable the capability of having a spellchecker when writing, as well as suggester of words.
