The project for this course is to build a smart text editor/processor that incorporates “intelligent” behaviors of modern-day text interfaces including autocomplete, flagging misspelled words and spelling auto-correct. In each module you’ll add a bit more functionality to your editor through the project associated with that module.

In order to develop this test editor application, I will focus on some basic fundamental data structures including linked lists and trees, and go on to touch on more advanced structures like hashsets, linked lists and tries. And front and center throughout this project will be the subject of code and algorithm efficiency and correctness.
