# Description of the project ðŸ§°
This is an interactive graphical map that will display geospatial data. The data that has been displayed in the application contains information regarding earthquakes and their magnitudes that have ocurred in the last years (earthquakes are displayed by simply creating geo-positioned markers on the map). Data has been extraced from different sources like The World Bank as well as making use of a well-known API called UnfoldingMaps which connects to Google Maps. In order to create some of the geometric figures, like the key table, I have made use of the Processing library.


## Relevant Libraries

* [Unfolding Maps](http://unfoldingmaps.org/javadoc/index.html)
* [Processing](https://processing.org/)

## Installation

Import this folder in Eclipse ('File' -> 'Import' -> 'Existing Projects into
Workspace', Select this folder, 'Finish')

If the import does not work follow the steps below.

* Create new Java project
* Copy+Paste all files into project
* Add all lib/*.jars to build path
* Set native library location for jogl.jar. Choose appropriate folder for your OS.
* Add data/ as src


## Troubleshooting

Switch Java Compiler to 1.6 if you get VM problems. (Processing should work with Java 1.6, and 1.7)
