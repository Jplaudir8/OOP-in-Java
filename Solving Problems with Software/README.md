# Description of projects ðŸ§°

The following projects have been developed by addressing problems using a method called the seven-step approach. This sort of framework has the following steps:

1. Work a small example.
2. Write Down what you did.
3. Find patterns.
4. Check by hand.
4. Translate to Code.
5. Run Test Cases.
5. Debug failed test cases.

## Perimeter of a Shape

* This project can calculate the perimeter of a shape in the coordinate plane.

## DNA Exercises

* This folder contains 3 projects which are all based on finding the number of genes that a strand of DNA contains.

## Manipulating CSV Files

* **CSVMax:** This project is about a progam that can find out the highest temperature in one or more CSV files.

* **ColdestTemperatureExercise:** Conversely, this project is about a progam that can find out the lowest temperature in one or more CSV files.

* **ParsingExportData:** This program will allow the user to query statistics regarding the exports of different countries around the world. This information could be the number of exporters of a specific item, listing exporters of specific items, etc.

## Converting Image Colors

* **BatchGrayscaleProgram:** Grayscale printing is much
cheaper than color printing. And some publications require that all images be converted to grayscale (Or we might be planning on doing some other, more complex image processing, like implementing an Optical Character Recognition program, who knows!). That processing could be simplified or even sped up by working with grayscale images. This project is about turning colored images into grayscale versions. This program is a combination of the **FirstGrayScaleExercise** and **SavingImages** programs (The first one generates the grayscale images whereas the latter saves these images).

* **BatchInversionsProgram:** A further implementation was performed to also be able to convert images to their negative colored version.


## BabyNames:

This was a final project which would also retrieve different statistics of baby names regarding the birthday. To be more specific, we can have use cases like finding out what would have been our name if we were born in a specific year, what was the ranking of our name depending on a specific year, and so on and so forth.
