# Some DNA concepts ðŸ§¬
A DNA is represented as a sequence of characters, this is what Genome Scientists call a Genomic String. These characters could be:

* Adenine
* Thymine
* Cytosine
* Guanine

The Human genome contains 3 billion characters.

*"ATCGTATACTGAAAACAGCTTTGAGAATCGTATACTGAAAACAGCTTTGAGAATCGTATACTGAAAACAGCTTTGAGAATCGTATACTGAAAACAGCTTTGAGAATCGTATACTGAAAACAGCTTTGAGAATCGTATACTGAAAACAGCTTTGAGAATCGTATACTGAATCGTATACTGAAAACAGCTTTGAGAATCGTATACTGAAAACAGCTTTGAGAATCGTATACTGAAAACAGCTTTGAGAATGAGAAAAACCGATCGTATACTGAAAACAGCTTTGAGAATCGTATACTGAAAACAGCTTTGAGAATCGTATACTGAAAACAGCTTTGAGAATCGTAA"*

> Each of these characters represent a __Nucleotide__, which is the building block of a DNA. 

> Three __Nucleotides__ make a __Codon__ which each describe one __Aminoacid__.

> The *"ATG"* Codon indicates the start of a gene, which is why it is called the __Start Codon__.

> Conversely, The *"TAA", "TGA" and "TAG"* Codons indicate the end of a gene, which is why they are called the __Stop Codons__.

> Everything that is enclosed between (and including) the Start and Stop Codon is a gene.

> Finding the start and stop codons is not enough to determine if a strand of characters is a gene, we also need to make sure that the number of nucleotides in this strand is a multiple of 3. Let's remember that a gene is composed of codons (which are each composed of 3 nucleotides).

> If we have three stop codons in a strand of characters, the stop codon we will use to determine a gene is going to be the first one that appears in the string of text (do not forget it also has to follow the multiple of 3 rule).
